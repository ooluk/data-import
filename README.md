# Data Import API
Data Import API for Ooluk Data Dictionary Manager

The Data Import API is used to import metadata into the [Ooluk Data Dictionary Manager](http://www.ooluk.com/). Data Dictionary Manager allows metadata documentation of data stores that store data as objects and attributes. This includes all relational databases, delimited data files, fixed length data files, JSON documents etc. Any structure that could contain hierarchy such as a JSON documents would need to be flattened out if there is a name collision.
